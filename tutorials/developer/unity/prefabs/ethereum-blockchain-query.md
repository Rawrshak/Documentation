# Ethereum Blockchain Query

**Location: Rawrshak/Sample/Blockchain**

This prefab and script shows the user how to query for Content Contract data. These queries work for any EVM compatible blockchains.&#x20;

The ContentManager queries, however, only run on blockchains that Rawrshak has deployed on. In this case, we've only deployed to Optimistic Kovan Testnet.&#x20;

These queries can be retrofitted to query any EVM compatible blockchain using ChainSafe's Gaming SDK.
