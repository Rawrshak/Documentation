# Rawrshak Asset

**Location: Rawrshak/Sample/Assets**

These prefabs are examples of how to load Text, Audio, Image, and Static 3D Assets in Unity. They query the Rawrshak Subgraph for wallet and asset information. It then uses the Rawrshak Asset libraries to download the asset and load the asset onto the scene.&#x20;

To use, the developer can simply drag the prefab onto the scene and run. The developer can check out the scripts attached to the prefabs on how to use it.
