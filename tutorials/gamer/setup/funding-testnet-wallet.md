# Funding Testnet Wallet

In order to transact on Ethereum and it's testnets, a wallet must hold some ETH. In order to get some testnet ETH (and testnet DAI) Optimism Kovan Network, we created this tutorial. We will use Paradigm's MultiFaucet in order to load our wallet with testnet ETH and DAI. Paradigm's faucet is great because it sends assets to your wallet on several test networks including Optimism Kovan.

#### **1. Go to the Paradigm MultiFaucet**
