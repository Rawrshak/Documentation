#### 5. Verify Data is uploaded using the _Data_ Transaction ID

Data Transaction ID: [TAPvrk0\_cEGhoeb9eYe96MIVp3lbpyqH7RlM6owfg3k](https://jqb67lsnh5yedinb436xtb555dbblj3zlotsvb7ndfgovda7qn4q.arweave.net/TAPvrk0\_cEGhoeb9eYe96MIVp3lbpyqH7RlM6owfg3k)

You can verify that the file has been processed and uploaded when the _Orange_ status has turned to _Green._&#x20;

The Data Transaction ID will be used when creating a Content Smart Contract or Asset in the NFT Launcher.

You can use the Data Tx ID to access the file with the uri:&#x20;
