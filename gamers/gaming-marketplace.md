# Gaming Marketplace

The Rawrshak gaming marketplace is designed to give a similar experience to existing MMO trading posts. The Rawrshak marketplace should be intuitive and familiar to both veteran and rookie gamers.

### Gaming Marketplace Features

The marketplace gives the user to create buy orders for assets they need and set a price they're willing to pay for it. Users can also create sell orders for assets they'd like to sell. Orders can be for multiple instances of an item.

#### Instant Buy/Sell

The marketplace gives the user to instantly purchase X amount of items with it's order matching system. It gives the user the ability to set how many they want to buy and set the maximum they're willing to spend to acquire items.&#x20;
