# Supported Wallets

## Wallet Requirements

* Desktop Web Browser and Mobile support
* Ability to change network endpoints
* WalletConnect integration (for in-game usage)

### Metamask

Currently, we only support the Metamask desktop browser wallet and Metamask mobile wallets.

{% hint style="info" %}
We've only tested the project with Metamask. It was the only wallet that allows the switching of the network endpoint which allows the user to connect to the Optimistic Kovan Testnet. If you've tested other wallets, please let us know on our Discord!

### Other Wallets

We have not tested other wallets.&#x20;
