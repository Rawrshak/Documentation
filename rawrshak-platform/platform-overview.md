# ðŸ›  Platform Overview

The Rawrshak Platform consists of several projects. Each project plays an important role in helping the gaming ecosystem grow.

## Deployable Smart Contracts

Rawrshak developed easily deployable smart contracts that allows game developers to focus on developing their game. These smart contracts are deployable using our Developer Dapp. The Developer Dapp lets the developer deploy in-game assets into NFTs, mints the assets, and sell the assets. Managing their asset collections, asset royalties, and marketplace revenue is all done through the Dapp.&#x20;

The ease of smart contract deployment lowers the barrier of entry for game developers and content creators. Using the Rawrshak smart contracts gives developers access to future on-chain gaming mechanisms developed for the Rawrshak ecosystem. The Rawrshak community will also be able to contribute and create on-chain ecosystem projects that take advantage of these gaming building blocks.

## Ecosystem Subgraphs

All assets that are created on the Rawrshak platform are indexed into the public Rawrshak subgraphs. Rawrshak community developers can access these subgraphs and create their own queries for data analysis. Game developers can access and create their own queries using our provided libraries. This allows for easy data querying for game developers, web developers, and other tools developers.

In addition to the content subgraphs, we are also making public the marketplace subgraphs. Anyone is free to access marketplace information and provide interesting gamer and game developer dashboards.
